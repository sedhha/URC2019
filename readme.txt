DON't panic we got this!
Initials:
    Tune the ports and check what is connected to what and better note down the things, pakka se.
    Explain Harshit about selecting the site.
    Write the program for feature matching, test all your old GUIs (MATLAB ones) use them here as
    well.
    Work on presentation.

1. Turn on the screen recorder.
2. Start the site selection from the top facing camera.
   When it shows site located go to that dense site plus also see through the camera feed
   if the site is full of brown soil or not.
3. Now the drill starts to come down. You start with microscope contouring for rock size
   and grain size distribution. Do offline processing of matlab code for the same to plot grain
   size distribution curve.
   Do feature matching process, for appropriate color and mineral matching properties. If you get
   a clear image of rocks, good for you else try to perform it with down facing camera.
   For offline processing, do feature matching as well as color matching to perform mineral
   identification.
4. Once microscope contouring is done, perform the mineral rock shape identification 
   with the down facing camera and save the images, don't forget to save the images in 
   any of the processes. Be really careful with this step and perform everything after
   reading the readme.
5. Now do the very easy pH analysis again with the down facing camera, read the rules of blurring
   image, the easiest step to perform.
6. By this time the soil should have been taken and turn on the sensors now. First start with
   atmospheric data, tune the data collect as much values as you can, now stop the script.
   For safety and reliability it will be better if you check the txt file to ensure that data has
   been obtained.
7. Now open your MATLAB GUI, ssh to raspberry pi, connect to serial port, collect all the data obtained
   from the rover and then you're good to go. Once the gauge movement is obtained, let it be there for
   atleast 15-20s once this is done, open atmospheric GUI and plot the datas there as well. Again wait
   for 15-20s.
8. Capture the GPS and magnetometer data now!
9. Now move to sand dunes, turn rover into different angles, capture the panoramic image, stitch them.
10. After stitching the image, again capture the GPS and compass data. Boom youre done for now. All 
    the very best for the presentation.
